### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is a repository of Valeriia Rutskaia.

I am a data scientist with a Master of Science degree in Physics. My background in physics has provided me with a solid understanding of statistical methods, programming languages, and data visualization techniques. As I always had passion about data, I underwent an intensive training in [Constructor Learning Data Science Bootcamp](https://learning.constructor.org/data-science/zurich) and successfully applied my skills to solve complex business problem (i.e. [Cortexia](https://www.cortexia.ch/?lang=en): check it out [here](https://github.com/valeriat/cortexia_darkzones_prediction)), develop predictive models and their explainability. 

I am confident in: 

- Python   
- Stats
- Web Scraping
- Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- SQL

I am familiar with 
- model explainability 
- responsible AI 
- Language models 
- docker and deployment
- MLops in general 

I am open to work on more DS projects for fun and professional growth.
